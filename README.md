# Kv-kinetic-models
Kinetic models of voltage-gated potassium channels.
For every channel different models were fit to experimental data kindly provided
by members of the Blue Brain Project. The models were fit directly to the experimental data
using the data2dynamics software (https://github.com/Data2Dynamics/d2d).

The models are organized with one directory for each channel and a subdirectory
for each model. The subdirectories contain the model, a description of the model,
a list of the model parameters, a summary of the behavior of the model under different
experimental conditions and a NEURON hoc file to test the model.
